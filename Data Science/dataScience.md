## Statistics <a name="statistics"></a>
Statistical computing is the process through which data scientists take raw data and create predictions and models backed by the data. Without an advanced knowledge of statistics it is difficult to succeed as a data scientist â€“ accordingly it is likely a good interviewer will try to probe your understanding of the subject matter with statistics-oriented data science interview questions. Be prepared to answer some fundamental statistics questions as part of your data science interview. 

1. What is the *Central Limit Theorem* and why is it important?

**Answer**: In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in most situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know?

**Answer**: Sampling is taking a small sample from a bigger population. There are many types of sampling:

Random: Everyone in the target population has an equal chance of being selected

Stratified: Working out proportions needed for the sample be representative (IQ, Gender, etc.)

Opportunity: Basically based on convenience

Systematic: Chooses subjects in a systematic (i.e. orderly / logical) way from the target population, like every nth participant on a list of names.

3. What is the difference between Type I vs Type II error?

**Answer**: Type I is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. Type II is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis.

4. What is linear regression? What do the terms P-value, coefficient, R-Squared value mean? What is the significance of each of these components?

**Answer**: **Linear regression** is an analysis that assesses whether one or more predictor variables explain the dependent (criterion) variable. The **p-value** for each term tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, a predictor that has a low p-value is likely to be a meaningful addition to your model because changes in the predictor's value are related to changes in the response variable. **Regression coefficients** represent the mean change in the response variable for one unit of change in the predictor variable while holding other predictors in the model constant. **R-squared** is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.

5. What are the assumptions required for linear regression?

**Answer**: There are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2. The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other, 3. There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables, and 4. Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable.

6. What is a statistical interaction?

**Answer**: Basically, an interaction is when the effect of one factor (input variable) on the dependent variable (output variable) differs among levels of another  factor.
