## Statistics <a name="statistics"></a>
Statistical computing is the process through which data scientists take raw data and create predictions and models backed by the data. Without an advanced knowledge of statistics it is difficult to succeed as a data scientist â€“ accordingly it is likely a good interviewer will try to probe your understanding of the subject matter with statistics-oriented data science interview questions. Be prepared to answer some fundamental statistics questions as part of your data science interview. 

1. What is the *Central Limit Theorem* and why is it important?

**Answer**: In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in most situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know?

**Answer**: Sampling is taking a small sample from a bigger population. There are many types of sampling:

Random: Everyone in the target population has an equal chance of being selected

Stratified: Working out proportions needed for the sample be representative (IQ, Gender, etc.)

Opportunity: Basically based on convenience

Systematic: Chooses subjects in a systematic (i.e. orderly / logical) way from the target population, like every nth participant on a list of names.
